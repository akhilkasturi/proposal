# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Smite Tool Kit

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that aids in storing and communicating information for competitive teams in the game SMITE.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will have multiple different functions that can be used at different times during the game. Each of these different features aims to solve a problem/make something easier within the game. For example, in the game SMITE, timing is very important, so the program will allow the user to enter a specific time in game that some specific event happened, and it will return the time that that event is set to repeat. Additionally, there will be other functions similar to this one that will all work together to improve a team's competitive gameplay.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have a program that has at least three functions that give you an advantage in the game SMITE

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can combine some of these functions together to create more complex functions that can take something which takes multiple steps and combines them into one function.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to use the program or allow others to use it in order to improve at the game SMITE.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I want to be able to use files from the game for some of my calculations within the functions, so I will review file reading. I also want to research how to use matrices in python because using matrices will allow me to do more complex calculations.
